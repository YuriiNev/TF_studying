# TF_studying
My Studying tasks for tensor flow

LESSON 1 (becoming familiar with Python) --> No Project 
https://colab.research.googe.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l01c01_introduction_to_colab_and_python.ipynb#scrollTo=xU-cJbMCR61P

LESSON 2 (Celsius to Fahrenheit) --> Project 1
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l02c01_celsius_to_fahrenheit.ipynb

LESSON 3 (image recognition) --> Project 2
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l03c01_classifying_images_of_clothing.ipynb

LESSON 4 (image recognition with convolutions) --> Project 3 
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l04c01_image_classification_with_cnns.ipynb

LESSON 5 (color image recognition with NN augmentations: dogs vs cats) --> Project 4 
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l05c01_dogs_vs_cats_without_augmentation.ipynb#scrollTo=FE7KNzPPVrVV
Project 4 --> cat\dogs with augmentation; Project 4_1 --> flowers with augmentation - my version; Project 4_2 --> flowers with augmentation - example;

LESSON 6 (transfer learning:) --> Project 5
